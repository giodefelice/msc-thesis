\section{The Drinfeld center}
In the previous section we saw that BFCs can be put on a spectrum ranging from symmetric fusion categories to modular categories. Physically, symmetric fusion categories are degenerate theories of anyons as they exhibit no topological behaviour. Conversely modular categories are very well behaved anyons theories.  In this section we introduce a general construction that turns braided fusion categories into modular categories, and we show its relationship with the Quantum double construction on a Hopf Algebra introduced in the first chapter.\\
Topological dependencies between objects in fusion categories are captured by the braided structure.
\begin{definition}[Half-braiding]
	A half-braiding on some object $X$ in a monoidal category $\cat$ is a natural isomorphism 
	$$ e^X : X \otimes (-) \Rightarrow (-) \otimes X$$
	satisfying: 
	$$e^X_{Y \otimes Z} =(id_Y \otimes e^X_Z) \circ (e^X_Y \otimes id_Z)$$ 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Drinfeld center]
	The braided (Drinfeld) center of a category $\mathcal{C}$ is the category $Z(\mathcal{C})$ with objects pairs $(X,e^X)$ where $X \in \mathcal{C}$ and $e_X$ is a half-braiding, and with morphisms given by the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ which commute with the half-braiding.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Yetter-Drinfeld modules]
	Let $H$ be a bialgebra, the category $\mathcal{D}_{H}^{lr}$ is the category of left-right Yetter-Drinfeld modules where objects are left $H$-modules which are simultaneously right $H$-comodules satisfying the following compatibility condition:

We have defined a functor $F_1: Z(Rep(H)) \rightarrow \mathcal{D}_H^{lr}$ which is identity on arrows and sends $(V,e_V)$ to the left-right Yetter-Drinfeld module with black $H$ action and white $H$ coaction. To see that it is well defined to say it is identity on arrows (and so faithful) note that if an $H$-module morphism $f$ is in $Z(Rep(H))$ then it commutes with the half-brading, in particular it commutes with the $H$-component of the half-braiding and therefore it commutes with the $H$-coaction as defined.\\

For the same reasons as for $F_1$, $F_2$ is faithful. To show $F_1$ and $F_2$ are equivalences of categories we still need to show they are full and essentially surjective.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $F_1$ is full: {\color{blue} [ The claims only work at the level of objects of the two categories, is it true that any morphism which commutes with the coaction also commute with the half braiding? ] }
	Suppose $f$ is a morphism $V \rightarrow W$ in $\mathcal{D}_H^{lr}$,
