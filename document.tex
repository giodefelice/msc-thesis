\section{Introduction}
Categories and diagrams \\
Symmetry, quantization and categorification \\
Categorification = replacing equalities with isomorphisms \cite{Baez98}.\\
For an account of the relationships between categorification and quantization consider \cite{Rowell17}.\\
Mathematically: from groups to quasitriangular hopf algebras, G to DG\\
Categorically: from symmetric fusion categories to modular categories\\
Physically: fermions/bosons to anyons, local symmetries to topological symmetries, 3D to 2D\\
Computation: from PQC to TQC, complexity theory\\
Logic: mirror the relationship, all statements about RepDG are statements in RepG, a modality, programming language

\section{Diagrams and Hopf Algebras}

\subsection{Monoidal categories}
In this section, we set in place the basic definitions and diagrammatic  intuitions which we will use throughout the thesis. The standard reference about basic category theory results is \cite{MacLane71}. Many of the definitions are taken from \cite{Abramsky11}. A more detailed and up to date survey on monoidal categories can be found in \cite{Etingof15}. For an introduction to diagrammatic reasoning in monoidal categories consider the first two chapters of \cite{Coecke17}. Many of the results in this section and their relationship to quantum mechanics can be found in \cite{Vicary12}. \\
%%CATEGORIES:
Recall the definition of a category.
\begin{definition}
	A category $\cat$ consists of the data:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a collection of objects $obj(\cat)$ 
		\item a collection of morphisms (or arrows) $arr(\cat)$
		\item domain and codomain assignments $dom, cod: arr(\cat) \rightarrow obj(\cat)$. For any two objects $a,b \in obj(\cat)$ we define the hom-set 
		$$ \cat (a,b) := \{ f \in arr(\cat) : a= dom(f), b=cod(f) \}$$
		\item for any triple of objects $a,b,c$ a composition map 
		$$c_{a,b,c}: \cat (a,b) \times \cat (b,c) \rightarrow \cat (a,c)$$
		We denote the composition by $g \circ f$, diagrammatically:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
			\node (0) at (-1, 0) {$a$};
			\node (1) at (0, 0.5) {$b$};
			\node (2) at (1, 0) {$c$};
			\node (3) at (-0.7, 0.4) {$f$};
			\node (3) at (0.7, 0.4) {$g$};
			\node (3) at (0, -0.3) {$g\circ f$};
			\draw [->] (0) to (1);
			\draw [->] (1) to (2);
			\draw [->] (0) to (2);
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}
		\item For any object $a$ an identity morphism $id_a: a \rightarrow a$ 
	\end{itemize}
	Satisfying the following axioms:
	\begin{equation*}
		h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f \quad f \circ id_a = f = id_b \circ f
	\end{equation*}
	
\end{definition}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (-1, 0) {$A$};
	\node (1) at (0, 0.5) {$B$};
	\node (2) at (1, 0) {$C$};
	\node (3) at (-0.7, 0.4) {$f$};
	\node (3) at (0.7, 0.4) {$g$};
	\node (3) at (0, -0.3) {$g\circ f$};
	\draw [->] (0) to (1);
	\draw [->] (1) to (2);
	\draw [->] (0) to (2);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The commutativity of the above diagram is a statement about $\cat$, and it has exactly the same information to its dual diagram. Where objects are one-dimensional wires and morphisms are (zero dimensional) boxes:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
	\node (0) at (-1, -1.4) {$A$};
	\node (1) at (-1.4, -0.1) {$B$};
	\node (2) at (-1, 1.4) {$C$};
	\node (3) at (1, -1.4) {$A$};
	\node (4) at (1, 1.4) {$C$};
	\node[scale=0.6,draw,circle] (5) at (-1, -0.5) {$f$};
	\node[scale=0.7,draw,circle] (6) at (-1, 0.4) {$g$};
	\node[scale=0.5,draw,circle] (7) at (1, 0) {$g\circ f$};
	\node (8) at (0, 0) {$=$};
	\draw (0) to (5);
	\draw (5) to (6);
	\draw [->] (6) to (2);
	\draw (3) to (7);
	\draw [->] (7) to (4);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
We will mainly use this second diagrammatic language in this work. When $\cat$ is just a category we only have one way of composing morphisms and the language is one dimensional.
\begin{example}
	Examples of categories are: $Sets$ of sets and functions, $FSets$ of finite sets and functions, $Rel$ of sets and relations, $Vect_k$ of vector spaces over $k$ and linear maps and $FVect_k$ of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps.
\end{example}
Category theory is a really good language for talking about equivalences and relationships between structures. This is achieved with the following tools.
\begin{definition}[Functor]
	A functor $F:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is a mapping that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item associates an object $F(X)$ of $\mathcal{D}$ to each object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$.
		\item associates to each morphism $f:X \rightarrow Y$ a morphism $F(f): F(X) \rightarrow F(Y)$ such that $F(id_X)=id_Y$ and $F(g\circ f)= F(g)\circ F(f)$ for all morphisms $f:X \rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y \rightarrow Z$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
For instance there is a functor $Q: Sets \rightarrow Vect_k$ called `1st quantization' and taking a set to the free vector space generated by that set.
Given two functors with matching source and target we can have natural transformations between them
\begin{definition}[Natural Transformation]
	Given categories $\cat$ and $\mathcal{D}$ and functors $F,G:\cat \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ a natural transformation $\alpha: F \Rightarrow G$ is an assignment to every object $a$ in $\cat$ of a morphism $\alpha_a:F(a) \rightarrow G(a)$ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that for each morphism $f:a \rightarrow b$, the following commutes:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
		\node (0) at (0,0) {$F(a)$};
		\node (1) at (0,1) {$G(a)$};
		\node (3) at (1,0) {$F(b)$};
		\node (4) at (1,1) {$G(b)$};
		\draw [->] (0)--(1) node[midway,left] {$\alpha_a$};
		\draw [->] (3)--(4) node[midway,right] {$\alpha_b$};
		\draw [->] (0)--(3) node[midway,below] {$F(f)$};
		\draw [->] (1)--(4) node[midway,above] {$G(f)$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	A natural isomorphism is a natural transformation such that all components are isomorphisms.
\end{definition}
%%%MONOIDAL CATEGORIES:
Recall that a monoid is a triple $(X, \times, 1)$ where $X$ is a set, $1 \in X$ and $\times$ is an associative and unital multiplication on $X$. The notion of a monoidal category is the categorification of a monoid. Elements of the set are replaced by objects in a category $\mathcal{C}$, multiplication by a bifunctor $\otimes: \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ and the equalities in the unit and association axioms are replaced by natural isomorphisms. In order for this new structure to be well-behaved we will also need to impose compatibility conditions. We obtain the following definition:
\begin{definition}[Monoidal category]
A monoidal category is a category $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a bifunctor $\otimes: \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ called tensor product, an object $1$ called unit object, a natural isomorphism
$$ a : -\otimes(- \otimes -) \xRightarrow{\sim} (-\otimes -) \otimes -$$ called associator, a natural isomorphism 
$$\lambda: 1 \otimes (-) \Rightarrow (-)$$ called left unitor and a natural isomorphism
$$ \rho: (-) \otimes 1 \Rightarrow (-)$$
called right unitor. Subject to the following coherence conditions holding for all objects $a,b,c,d$ in $\mathcal{C}$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pentagon axiom: the following diagram commutes
    \begin{center}
    	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    	\node (0) at (0,0) {$(a\otimes (b \otimes c)) \otimes d$};
    	\node (1) at (0,1) {$((a\otimes b) \otimes c) \otimes d$};
    	\node (2) at (1,1.5) {$(a\otimes b) \otimes (c \otimes d)$};
    	\node (3) at (2,1) {$a\otimes (b \otimes (c \otimes d))$};
    	\node (4) at (2,0) {$a\otimes ((b \otimes c) \otimes d)$};
    	\draw [->] (1)--(2) node[midway,left] {$\alpha_{a \otimes b,c,d}$};
    	\draw [->] (2)--(3) node[midway,right] {$\alpha_{a, b,c \otimes d}$};
    	\draw [->] (1)--(0) node[midway,left] {$\alpha_{a, b,c} \otimes id_d$};
    	\draw [->] (0)--(4) node[midway,below] {$\alpha_{a,b \otimes c,d}$};
    	\draw [->] (4)--(3) node[midway,right] {$id_a \otimes \alpha_{b,c,d}$};
    	\end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \item Triangle identity: the following diagram commutes
    \begin{center}
    	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    	\node (0) at (0,0) {$(a\otimes 1) \otimes b$};
    	\node (1) at (2,0) {$(a\otimes 1) \otimes b$};
    	\node (2) at (1,-1) {$a\otimes b$};
    	\draw [->] (0)--(1) node[midway,above] {$\alpha_{a ,1,b}$};
    	\draw [->] (1)--(2) node[midway,right] {$id_a \otimes \lambda_b$};
    	\draw [->] (0)--(2) node[midway,left] {$\rho_a \otimes id_b$};
    	\end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Let us give three important examples of monoidal categories.
\begin{example}
The category $Sets$ of sets and functions is monoidal with the cartesian product $\times$ as bifunctor and the singleton set as unit object.\\
The category $Vect_k$ of finite dimensional vector spaces over a field $k$ is monoidal with the usual tensor product $\otimes$ and the one dimensional vector space $k$ as unit object.\\
The category $Rel$ of sets and relations is monoidal with the cartesian product $\times$ and the singleton as unit object.
\end{example}
The more structure comes with a category the more complicated diagrams we can draw. Monoidal categories have a two-dimensional diagrammatic language. The presence of unitors and associators and the conditions they satisfy make sure that this graphical language is well behaved. This is known as the coherence theorem for monoidal categories and can be found in \cite{MacLane71}. It says that any well formed diagram in a monoidal category, made up of associators and unitors commutes. When the associators are trivial morphisms (i.e identity morphisms) we say the category is strict monoidal. It is known that every monoidal category is equivalent to a strict one \cite{MacLane71}, but it is sometimes useful to take associators into account as we will see in our discussion on permutational quantum computation.\\
We write the tensor of two morphisms $f \otimes g : A \otimes B \rightarrow C \otimes D$ simply putting them side by side:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
	\node (0) at (0, -1.2) {$A$};
	\node (1) at (1, -1.2) {$B$};
	\node (2) at (0, 1.2) {$C$};
	\node (3) at (1, 1.2) {$D$};
	\node[scale=0.7,draw,circle] (5) at (0, 0) {$f$};
	\node[scale=0.7,draw,circle] (6) at (1, 0) {$g$};
	\draw (0) to (5);
	\draw [->] (5) to (2);
	\draw (1) to (6);
	\draw [->] (6) to (3);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
In our diagrams we can picture the unit $I$ of the tensor as the plane on which we are drawing. Indeed we could imagine drawing as many copies as we wanted of $id_I$ on the previous diagram to obtain obtain an equivalent diagram as $id_I \otimes f = f$ for any morphism $f$. So really the identity on $I$ is just the empty diagram which we can stick next to any diagram we like.
\begin{definition}[States and costates]
	Given a system $A$, a state of is a morphism $1 \rightarrow A$. A costate (or effect) of $A$ is a morphism $A \rightarrow 1$. In the diagrammatic language we draw states and costates respectively:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
		\node[scale=0.5,buffer] (1) {$a$}; 
		\node (2) at (0.3,0.7) {$A$};
		\draw (1)--(0,1);
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\quad \quad
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
		\node[scale=0.5,buffer,rotate=180] (1) at (0,0) {$q$}; 
		\node (2) at (0.3,-0.7) {$B$};
		\draw (1)--(0,-1);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
			
	
\end{definition}


%%%DIAGRAMS:
\begin{remark}
	It is perhaps useful to understand monoidal categories as degenerate 2-categories. Although this viewpoint requires one additional initial step of abstraction (the definition of a 2-category), it gives us the diagrammatic language for monoidal categories for free. For the rigorous definition of a 2-category we refer to [BAEZ], for our purposes we will only need the intuition. A 2-category is a collection of objects with 1-arrows between them and 2-arrows between the 1-arrows. Note that there are two ways of composing the 2-arrows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item vertical composition:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
			\node (0) at (0,0) {.};
			\node (1) at (2,0) {.};
			\draw[->] (0) to (1);
			\draw[->, bend right=90] (0) to (1);
			\draw[->, bend left=90] (0) to (1);
			\draw[double, thick, ->] (1,-0.6) to (1,-0.2);
			\draw[double, thick, ->] (1,0.2) to (1,0.6);
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}
		\item parallel composition:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
			\node (0) at (0,0) {.};
			\node (1) at (2,0) {.};
			\node (2) at (4,0) {.};
			\draw[->, bend right=40] (0) to (1);
			\draw[->, bend left=40] (0) to (1);
			\draw[->, bend right=40] (1) to (2);
			\draw[->, bend left=40] (1) to (2);
			\draw[double, thick, ->] (1,-0.2) to (1,0.2);
			\draw[double, thick, ->] (3,-0.2) to (3,0.2);
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}
	\end{itemize}
	Taking the dual of the above diagrams we obtain the diagrammatic language. Monoidal categories are 2-categories with only one 0-object called $1$. We can think of the 0-object as the underlying plane, wires carry systems (1-arrows), boxes are morphisms (2-arrows). We recover the given definition of monoidal category by calling 1-arrow objects, and 2-arrows morphisms. The unit object $1$ is then the identity 1-arrow $1 \rightarrow 1$ which is simply denoted $1$.
\end{remark}
 
\begin{example}
The cartesian product in $Sets$ $A \times B$ of sets $A$ and $B$, satisfies the universal properties of a categorical product, in the sense that we have projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ such that if $f$ and $g$ are maps from some set $C$ there is a unique function $h$ making the following diagram commute:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (-1, 0) {$A$};
	\node (1) at (1, 0) {$B$};
	\node (2) at (0, 1) {$A \times B$};
	\node (3) at (0, -1) {$C$};
	\node (4) at (0.2, 0) {$h$};
	\node (5) at (-0.8, 0.6) {$p_1$};
	\node (6) at (0.8, 0.6) {$p_2$};
	\node (7) at (-0.8, -0.6) {$f$};
	\node (8) at (0.8, -0.6) {$g$};
	\draw [->] (2) to (0);
	\draw [->] (2) to (1);
	\draw [->] (3) to (1);
	\draw [->] (3) to (0);
	\draw [->] (3) to (2);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Because of this property all states of $(Sets,\times)$ are separable. This category is the ambient Cartesian world of classical physics.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
In $Vect_k$ states are vectors and costates are functionals. Note that the diagrammatic notation provides a two-dimensional generalisation of Dirac's notation. The category $Hilb$ of Hilbert spaces and linear maps is monoidal when equipped with the usual tensor product $\otimes$. Note that $\otimes$ is not a categorical product, and in fact we can have entangled states. Quantum mechanics is based on $(Hilb, \otimes)$ \cite{Vicary12}.
\end{example}
\begin{definition}[Scalars]
Scalars in a monoidal category are morphisms $1 \rightarrow 1$.
\end{definition}
The category $Sets$ has only one scalar. $Rel$ has two scalars forming the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_2$ under composition. $Vect_k$ has scalars from $k$. Given a vector and a functional we obtain a scalar by composing them analogously to Dirac's formalism.
\begin{definition}[BMC]
	A braided monoidal category is a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a natural isomorphism $B_{a,b} : a \otimes b \rightarrow b \otimes a$ called braiding, subject to the following compatibility conditions (called hexagon equations):
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]

		\node (1) at (-0.5,1) {$a\otimes (b \otimes c)$};
		\node (2) at (1.5,1) {$(b\otimes c)\otimes a$};
		\node (3) at (2,0) {$b\otimes (c\otimes a)$};
		\node (4) at (-0.5,-1) {$(b\otimes a)\otimes c$};

		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	\begin{center}

		\node (1) at (-0.5,1) {$(a\otimes b) \otimes c$};
		\node (2) at (1.5,1) {$c\otimes (a\otimes b)$};
		\node (3) at (2,0) {$(c\otimes a)\otimes b$};
		\node (4) at (-0.5,-1) {$a\otimes (c\otimes b)$};
		\node (5) at (1.5,-1) {$(a\otimes c)\otimes b$};
		\draw [->] (0)--(1) node[midway,left] {$\alpha_{a,b,c}$};

		\draw [->] (2)--(3) node[midway,right] {$\alpha_{c,a,b}$};
		\draw [->] (0)--(4) node[midway,left] {$id_a \otimes B_{b,c}$};

		\draw [->] (5)--(3) node[midway,right] {$B_{a,c} \otimes id_b$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	
\end{definition}
In the diagrammatic language this means we have braidings:

Both $Sets$ and $Hilb$ are examples of symmetric monoidal categories in the following sense.
\begin{definition}[SMC]
	A braided monoidal category is symmetric if the braiding $B_{a,b}$ satisfies $$B_{a,b} \circ B_{b,a} = id_{a\otimes b}$$
	For all objects $a,b$
\end{definition}
In a SMC the braiding is called symmetry morphism and is denoted
\begin{center}
	\symAB	
\end{center}
It satisfies:
\symequation
We will now describe some new classes of examples of monoidal categories. These are of a different nature to the categories we have seen so far.
\begin{definition}[PROPs]
	A $PROP$ (products and permutations category) is a strict symmetric monoidal category where every object is of the form $x^{\otimes n}$ for a single object $x$ and $n \geq 0$.
\end{definition}
This means that we are only allowed one type of wire when drawing diagrams about $PROPs$ but we can use as many copies as we like and we can make swaps with them. Categories satisfying these properties are useful syntactic tools as we will see.
One way to think of a $PROP$ $A$ is as an abstract algebraic structure carrying some axioms, we can then instantiate those axioms in some other symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ by considering symmetric monoidal functors $F: A \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$. We call such functors algebras or models of $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$. If $A$ is defined in terms of generators and relations (as is most often done), the choice of such functor corresponds to the choice of one object from $\mathcal{C}$ and morphisms on that object respecting the defining relations of $A$. On its own $A$ has no clear interpretation, it just defines a syntax, but if $\mathcal{C}$ is a semantic category (i.e one with a clear interpretation) then $F$ is a `filling' of the syntax with meaning. This reasoning was first proposed in Lawvere's Phd thesis in 1963 \cite{Lawvere63}.\\
It will sometimes be useful to drop the `permutational' structure of $PROPs$.
\begin{definition}[PRO]
	A $PRO$ (products category) is a strict monoidal category where every object is of the form $x^{\otimes n}$ for a single object $x$ and $n \geq 0$.
\end{definition}
The semantic categories we will consider the most are $Sets$ and $Hilb$. One important difference between them is that $Hilb$ exhibits duality.
\begin{definition}[Rigidity]
	Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a monoidal category and $A\in obj(\mathcal{C})$. A left-dual of $A$ is an object $A^*$ with morphisms
	\begin{center}
		\cupA \, \capA
	\end{center}
	Satisfying the snake equations:
	\snake
	\snakestar
	If every object has a left-dual, we say that $\mathcal{C}$ is left-rigid.
	Similarly we can define right-duals and right-rigid categories by interchanging the roles of $A$ and $A^\star$ in the definition.
\end{definition}
Given a (left/right) rigid structure we can define (left/right)transpose as follows.
\begin{definition}[Transpose]
	Given a (left/right) rigid category $\cat$ and any process $f:A \rightarrow B$ the (left/right) transpose $f^*$ (or left transpose $f^l$, right transpose $f^r$ if it is not clear from context) is:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node[draw, trapezium, trapezium angle=70, shape border rotate=180] (0) at (0,0) {$f$};
		\draw[->] (0) to (0,-0.7);
		\draw[->] (0,0.7) to (0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\, = \,
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node[draw, trapezium, trapezium angle=70,] (0) at (0,0) {$f$};
	\draw[->] (0,-0.7)--(0)--(0,0.7);
	\draw[bend right=90] (0,0.7) to (-0.7,0.7);
	\draw[->] (-0.7,0.7) to (-0.7,-0.7);
	\draw[bend right=90] (0,-0.7) to (0.7,-0.7);
	\draw[->] (0.7,0.7) to (0.7,-0.7);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}	
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Trace]
	In a symmetric monoidal category $\cat$, if $A$ has a left dual $A^\star$, the trace of some morphism $f:A \rightarrow A$ is defined as the following scalar:
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
	\node[scale=0.7, draw, trapezium, trapezium angle=70,] (0) at (0,0) {$f$};
	\draw[->] (0,-0.7)--(0)--(0,0.7);
	\draw[bend right=90] (0,0.7) to (-0.7,0.7);
	\draw[->] (-0.7,0.7) to (-0.7,-0.7);
	\draw[bend left=90] (0,-1.3) to (-0.7,-1.3);
	\draw[->] (-0.7,-0.7) to (0,-1.3);
	\draw[->] (0,-0.7) to (-0.7,-1.3);
	\end{tikzpicture}	
	\end{center}
\end{definition}
A pivotal structure on a rigid monoidal category $\cat$ is a natural isomorphism $id_\cat \Rightarrow (-)^{\star \star}$. It allows to define traces without using the symmetry. Most categories we will consider have both sided duals, and therefore a trivial (identity) pivotal structure. Given a pivotal structure we can define left pivotal traces as:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
	\node[scale=0.7, draw, trapezium, trapezium angle=70,] (0) at (0,0) {$f$};
	\draw[->] (0,-0.7)--(0)--(0,0.7);
	\draw[bend right=90] (0,0.7) to (-0.7,0.7);
	\draw[->] (-0.7,0.7) to (-0.7,-0.7);
	\draw[bend left=90] (0,-0.7) to (-0.7,-0.7);
	\end{tikzpicture}	
\end{center}
Where we have hidden the pivotal natural isomorphism. Similarly we can define right pivotal traces on endomorphisms in the obvious way.
\begin{definition}
	A rigid monoidal category with a pivotal strucutre is spherical if left and right traces coincide. In a spherical category, if $a$ is an object, the trace $tr: End(a) \rightarrow End(1)$ is well defined and $tr(id_a)$ is called the categorical (or quantum) dimension of $a$. 
\end{definition}
For a braided monoidal category, giving a spherical structure is equivalent to giving a ribbon structure \cite{Mueger12} where:
\begin{definition}
	A ribbon (or twist) structure on a braided monoidal category with left duality $\star$ is a natural isomorphism $\theta: id_\cat \Rightarrow id_\cat$ satisfying:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node[scale=0.7, draw, trapezium, trapezium angle=90] (0) at (0,0) {$\theta_{a \otimes b}$};
	\draw (0) to (-0.2,-1.5);
	\draw (-0.2,1) to (0);
	\draw (0) to (0.2,-1.5);
	\draw (0.2,1) to (0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\, = \,
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node[scale=0.7, draw, trapezium, trapezium angle=90] (0) at (-0.3,0.5) {$\theta_{a}$};
	\node[scale=0.7, draw, trapezium, trapezium angle=90] (1) at (0.3,0.5) {$\theta_{b}$};
	\node (2) at (0,0) {};
	\node (3) at (0,-1) {};
	\draw (0) to (-0.3,1);
	\draw (1) to (0.3,1);
	\draw (0)--(0.3,-0.5)--(3)--(-0.3,-1.5);
	\draw (1)--(2)--(-0.3,-0.5)--(0.3,-1.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\end{equation}
	and compatible with the rigid structure $(\theta_a)^\star = \theta_{a^\star}$ 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	It can be shown that in the diagrammatic language, having a ribbon structure really corresponds to replacing wires by ribbons which we can twist. We won't use such diagrammatic language, but in the section on modular categories the twist will be an important process.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Hopf Algebras}
Now that we have set in place a diagrammatic machinery based on monoidal categories, let us make use of it. In this section we will meet some mathematical structures which have been used by mathematicians to describe symmetry. The notion of Hopf algebras is a powerful generalization of that of a group. Since their discovery in the 1940s, Hopf algebras have been used in various fields of pure mathematics (such as number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory) and have found applications in Quantum mechanics. Most of the results of this section can be found in \cite{Majid95}. 
\begin{definition}[Monoid]
	$\Delta$ is a $PRO$ generated by morphisms (\mult, \unit) satisfying associativity: \associativity
	and the unit law: \unitlaw
\end{definition}
Models of $\Delta$ in monoidal categories are called monoids and they are very well known, examples include the natural numbers under addition, lists of some alphabet under concatenation and any group. Taking the opposite category $\Delta^{op}$ corresponds to flipping all the diagrams.
\begin{definition}[Comonoid]
	$\Delta^{op}$ is a $PRO$ generated (\comult, \counit) satisfying coassociativity: \coassociativity and the counit law: \counitlaw
\end{definition}
Models of these are comonoids, the most common example is the copy map on any set with `delete' as counit.
Monoids and comonoids are simple structures that we can stick together to form more complicated ones. Bialgebras arise from one type of interaction of a monoid and comonoid.
\begin{definition}[Bialg]
	$Bialg$ is a $PROP$ generated by (\mult, \unit, \comult, \counit), where \mult and \unit form a monoid, \comult and \counit a comonoid and the morphisms additionally satisfy the following laws:
	\bialgebralaw
	\copylaw
	\cocopylaw
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{gathered}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
			\node[scale=0.5,draw,circle,fill=black] (0) at (0,0) {};
			\node[scale=0.5,draw,circle,fill=white] (1) at (0,1) {};
			\draw (0) to (1);
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{gathered}
		\, = \,
	\end{equation}
	Where the empty diagram is the identity on the tensor unit.
\end{definition}
Models of $Bialg$ in $Vect$ are bialgebras. We leave examples for later as we are now ready to introduce one of the main topics of this thesis.
\begin{definition}[Hopf]
	$Hopf$ is a $PROP$ generated by (\mult , \unit , \comult , \counit , \antipode). Where (\mult, \unit, \comult, \counit) is a bialgebra and the antipode $S$ satisfies the Hopf law:
	\hopflaw
\end{definition}
We will argue that $Hopf$ is a good syntax to talk about symmetry. Let us start by  instantiating $G: Hopf \rightarrow Sets$. This corresponds to choosing a set $G$, with a binary function $G \times G \rightarrow G$ (or multiplication) with a unit. Using the counit rule it is easy to see that the comultiplication in $Sets$ must be the copy map $g \mapsto (g,g)$ so that the antipode is the morphism $g \mapsto g^{-1}$ and $G$ forms a group. Since the $19^{th}$ century groups have been used by mathematicians and physicists to describe symmetry.
\begin{example}[Finite groups]
	We will only make use of the following classes of finite groups:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mathbb{Z}_n$ the cyclic group with $n$ elements.
		\item $S_n$ the symmetric group, can be seen as the group of permutations of a set with $n$ elements, has order $n!$. $S_3$ is the smallest non-abelian group up to isomorphism.  
	\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Groups of matrices]
	Here we will fix some notation on the infinite groups of matrices we will meet. All matrices we will consider are over the complex numbers. $GL(n)$ is the group of invertible $n$ by $n$ complex matrices. $U(n)$ is the group of unitary $n \times n$ matrices (i.e such that $U^{\dagger}U = UU^\dagger = I$). The special unitary group $SU(n)$ is the subgroup of $U(n)$ consisting of matrices with determinant $1$. The representation theory of $SU(n)$ is widely used in particle physics, for instance representations of $SU(2)$ model the behaviour of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles. 
\end{example}
If we take a model of $H:Hopf \rightarrow Vect$ we obtain what is known as a Hopf Algebra.
\begin{example}[Group algebras]
	If $G$ is a group with unit $e$, the group algebra $\mathbb{C}G$ (of dimension $|G|$) is a hopf algebra with multiplication linearly generated by $\ket{g}\otimes \ket{h} \rightarrow \ket{gh}$, unit $\ket{e}$, comultplication generated by $\ket{g} \rightarrow \ket{g} \otimes \ket{g}$ and counit $\sum_g \bra{g}$.
\end{example}
The previous example gives the usual definition of a group algebra which, for finite sets and finite dimensional vector spaces is just the composition $Q \circ G$ (as shown in the diagram) where $Q$ is the 1st quantization functor. It is easy to see that $Q$ preserves the monoidal structure as well as the symmetry morphisms (we say $Q$ is a symmetric monoidal functor) so that the composition is also symmetric monoidal and $Q \circ G$ is a model of $Hopf$.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (-1, 0) {$FSets$};
	\node (1) at (1, 0) {$FVect$};
	\node (2) at (0, 1) {$Hopf$};
	\node (5) at (-0.8, 0.6) {$G$};
	\node (6) at (0.8, 0.6) {$\mathbb{C}G$};
	\node (7) at (0, -0.3) {$Q$};
	\draw [->] (2) to (0);
	\draw [->] (2) to (1);
	\draw [->] (0) to (1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
In this case the comultiplication in $Hilb$ is the linearisation of the copy map (the copy map on some basis extended linearly to the whole Hilbert space) which is co-commutative. For a general $H:Hopf \rightarrow Vect$ this doesn't have to be the case. Hopf algebras provide a broader framework to talk about symmetry, as we can have non co-commutative Hopf algebras. We can see it as a quantization of the notion of symmetry, it will allow us to describe symmetries of quantum systems. Physically we will see that Hopf algebras allow to talk about local symmetries and exchange statistics on the same footing \cite{Slingerland02}. In particular if the Hopf algebra is not cocommutative the exchange statistics can be highly non-trivial, in which case they will describe the symmetries of anyons.
The following two propositions are simple but important results about the antipode of a hopf algebra.
\begin{proposition}
	The antipode of a Hopf algebra is unique. It follows that being a Hopf algebra is a property of bialgebras. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}
	The most trivial example of quasitriangular hopf algebras are the cocommutative ones. It is easy to check that if $H$ is cocommutative, it is quasitriangular with
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.3]
	\node[scale=0.5,draw,circle, fill=black] (0) at (0,0) {};
	\node[scale=0.5,draw,circle, fill=black] (1) at (1,0) {};
	\draw (0) to (0,1);
	\draw (1) to (1,1);

	as $R$-matrix. 
\end{example}
We will only be considering finite dimensional Hopf Algebras, as for finite dimensional vector spaces, these always have duals.
\begin{definition}[Dual Hopf Algebra]
	For a finite dimensional Hopf Algebra $H$ the dual Hopf algebra is the vector space $H^{\star}$ of linear functionals on $H$ with Hopf Algebra structure given by transposing all of the structure.
\end{definition}
Given any finite dimensional hopf algebra $H$ with invertible antipode there is a standard way of constructing a Quasitriangular Hopf Algebra first introduced by Drinfeld \cite{Drinfeld87}. It will be implicit from now on that all Hopf algebras (and vector spaces) are finite-dimensional unless stated otherwise.
\begin{definition}[Quantum double of a Hopf algebra]
	The quantum double of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra $(H,\mu, 1, \Delta, \epsilon, S)$ with invertible antipode is the vector space $H \otimes H^\star$, with the following structure:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item multiplication and unit:

It is easy to check this is indeed a Hopf algebra and that it is quasitriangular with universal $R$-matrix:

\subsection{Representations of Hopf algebras}
Recall that a group describes the symmetries of some space $X$ when it acts on it (e.g crystals, classical symmetries= symmetries of sets). If we apply the same reasoning to Hopf Algebras we have to make $H$ act on some quantum state space (i.e Hilbert space). So our object of study is not $H$ on its own but rather a module (or representation) of $H$.

Where $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space. Note that the above diagram represents a linear map, all diagrams we will be drawing in this section are diagrams in $Hilb$. In order for $V$ to be a representation the following must hold.
\begin{definition}[Module]
	Let $H$ be bialgebra, a (left) $H$-module (or representation of $H$) is a vector space $V$ together with a (left) action of $H$ on $V$.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, black/.style={draw,regular polygon,
			regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}]
		\node (0) at (0, -1.2) {$V$};
		\node[black] (1) at (0, 0) {};
		\node (2) at (0, 1) {};
		\node (3) at (-0.7, -1.2) {$H$};
		\draw (0) to (1);
		\draw (1) to (2);
		\draw[bend left] (3) to (1);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	Satisfying the following conditions:
	\modulelaw
\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8, black/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}]
	\node (0) at (0, -1.2) {};
	\node[black] (1) at (0, 0) {};
	\node[scale=0.6,draw,circle,fill=black] (3) at (-0.7, -0.6) {};
	\draw (0) to (1);
	\draw (1) to (0, 1);
	\draw[bend left] (3) to (1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\quad = \,
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8, black/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}]
	\node (0) at (0, -1.2) {};
	\draw (0) to (0, 1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
	A right $H$-module is defined similarly with a right $H$-action.
\end{definition}

Suppose $V$ and $W$ are representations of $H$, then we say $f:V \rightarrow W$ (a linear map) is a $H$-module homomorphism (or intertwiner) if:
\intertwinerlaw
Where the black square denotes the action of $H$ on $W$. \\
Dually we can define $H$-comodules and $H$-comodule homorphisms as follows.
\begin{definition}[Comodule]
	Let $H$ be bialgebra, an $H$-comodule is a vector space $V$ together with a coaction of $H$ on $V$.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, black/.style={draw,regular polygon,
			regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}]
		\node (0) at (0, -1.2) {$V$};
		\node[black] (1) at (0, 0) {};
		\node (2) at (0, 1) {};
		\node (3) at (-0.7, 1.2) {$H$};
		\draw (0) to (1);
		\draw (1) to (2);
		\draw[bend left] (1) to (3);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	Satisfying the following conditions:
	\comodulelaw
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8, black/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}]
	\node (0) at (0, 1.2) {};
	\node[black] (1) at (0, 0) {};
	\node[scale=0.6,draw,circle,fill=white] (3) at (-0.7, 0.6) {};
	\draw (0) to (1);
	\draw (1) to (0, -1);
	\draw[bend right] (3) to (1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\, = \,
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8, black/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}]
	\draw (0,-1) to (0, 1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\end{equation}
	A right $H$-comodule is defined similarly with a right $H$-coaction. And $H$-comodule homomorphisms are linear maps which commute with the $H$-coaction.
\end{definition}
Let us consider, the category $Rep(H)$ where objects are representations of $H$ and morphisms intertwiners. It is easy to see that the axioms of a category are satisfied, composition is just lifted from vector spaces. This category has really nice structure induced from the defining axioms of hopf algebras.
\begin{proposition}
	$Rep(H)$ is a monoidal category for any bialgebra $H$ with tensor unit the trivial one-dimensional representation $(\mathbb{C}, \counit)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Given $H$-modules $V$ and $W$ (with white and black actions respectively), $V\otimes W$ has natural $H$-module structure induced by the comultiplication:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, whit/.style={draw,regular polygon,
			regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}, black/.style={draw,regular polygon, regular polygon sides=4,fill=black}]
		\node (0) at (0, -0.2) {$V$};
		\node[whit] (1) at (0, 1.3) {};
		\node[black] (2) at (1, 1.3) {};
		\node[scale=0.8,draw,circle, fill=white] (3) at (-0.7, 0.5) {};
		\node (4) at (-0.7, -0.2) {$H$};
		\node (5) at (1, -0.2) {$W$};
		\draw (4) to (3);
		\draw (0) to (1);
		\draw (5) to (2);
		\draw (1) to (0,2);
		\draw (2) to (1,2);
		\draw[bend left] (3) to (1);
		\draw[bend right] (3) to (2);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	And $V\otimes W$ with this action is indeed a module as:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{gathered}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7, whit/.style={draw,regular polygon,
			regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}, black/.style={draw,regular polygon, regular polygon sides=4,fill=black}]

	Using the module laws and the antipode law. A similar derivation holds for the cap.
\end{proof}
We can see that the proof relies on the existence of the antipode. If a skew-antipode $\bar{S}$ exists, $Rep(H)$ is right-rigid, where the right dual is defined:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, whit/.style={draw,regular polygon,
	regular polygon sides=4,fill=white},]
\node[scale=0.5, whit] (0) at (0,0) {R};
\node (1) at (-0.5, -0.9) {$H$};
\node (2) at (0, -0.9) {$V^\star$};
\draw (2) to (0);
\draw (0) to (0, 0.7);
\draw[bend left] (1) to (0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{gathered}
\, := \,
\begin{gathered}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, whit/.style={draw,regular polygon,
	regular polygon sides=4,fill=white},]
\node[scale=0.4, whit] (0) at (0,0) {};
\node (1) at (-0.5, -0.9) {$H$};
\node (2) at (0, -0.9) {$V^\star$};
\node[scale=0.5, whit] (3) at (-0.5,0) {$\bar{S}$};
\draw (2) to (0);
\draw (0) to (0, 0.7);
\draw (1) to (3);
\draw[bend left=60] (3) to (0.3, 0.4);
\draw[bend left=60] (0.3, 0.4) to (0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
The proof that this choice works is very similar to the one above. In particular, $\bar{S}$ exists when the antipode is an invertible morphism as we can define $\bar{S}=S - S^{-1}$ If the antipode coincides with the skew antipode then $Rep(H)$ then left and right duals in $Rep(H)$ coincide, we say it is rigid.

\subsection{Tannaka duality}
This section is only meant as a motivation for the study of Hopf Algebras and we wont prove the reconstruction theorems, surveys on Tannaka reconstruction are given by \cite{Vercruysse12} and \cite{Joyal91}.\\
Reconstruction results are recipes which produce all the examples of a class of categories (i.e categories with some fixed structure) from simpler mathematical objects. As we have seen in the previous sections, the structure of categories of $H$-modules is induced from the axioms of the Hopf Algebra $H$. It is surprising that Hopf algebras underly most of the categories with this structure.
\begin{theorem}[Tannaka reconstruction]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Any monoidal category $\cat$ equipped with a fiber functor (i.e a strict monoidal functor) $U: \cat \rightarrow Vect$ is equivalent to $Rep(B)$ where $B$ is a bialgebra.
		\item Any (braided) rigid monoidal category equipped with a fiber functor (here this means strict (braided) rigid monoidal functor) to $Vect$ is equivalent to $Rep(H)$ for some (quasitriangular) hopf algebra $H$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
Note that any category can be seen as a process theory in the sense of \cite{Abramsky04} and \cite{Coecke17}. Objects are systems and morphisms are their possible physical evolutions. The tensor product of a monoidal category can then be regarded as a way of forming composed systems. Quantum systems usually exhibit duality (particle, antiparticle pairs) and entanglement which are captured by the rigid structure of the category. From this perspective, this reconstruction result has an interesting physical interpretation. It says that any physical theory (monoidal category) is completely determined by the symmetries of the systems under consideration (the algebra structure). In the next section we will take this reasoning further to study physical theories of certain topological quantum systems.

\section{The Algebra of Anyons}
In this section we introduce the physics of Anyons and use the framework developed in the first section to define categorical models for theories of these particles. For an introduction to the physics of anyons consider the foundational paper \cite{Kitaev06} or Simon's notes \cite{Simon16}, for a categorical presentation \cite{Panangaden11} and for a thorough survey of the mathematical aspects of anyons \cite{Rowell17}.\\
In the first section we introduce the physics and make the link with braided fusion categories, in the second part of we will develop the categorical formalism and the third part is dedicated to one result where quantification and categorical constructions play an important role.\\~\\
To understand how anyons arise physically, let us consider $n$ indistinguishable particles evolving in space. The quantum amplitude for a space-time evolution of the system will depend on the topology of the particle word-lines and not on the detailed geometry. This means that isotopic space-time evolution will yield the same amplitude.\\
To formalize the situation suppose we have $n$ indistinguishable particles in $D$ dimensions, the configuration space can be written as:
$$ \mathrm{C}=(\mathbb{R}^{nD}-\Delta)/S_n$$
Where $\Delta$ is the space of coincidences (where at least two of the $n$ particles occupy the same position in $\mathbb{R}^D$). We are quotienting the space by $S_n$ to account for the indistinguishability of the particles (i.e we do not care about the order of the $n$ coordinates in $D$ dimensions). 
Let us fix the starting and endpoint in the configuration space, the space of paths from starting to endpoint $\mathrm{C}$ divides into topologically distinct classes, described by the fundamental group $\pi_1(\mathrm{C})$. These classes account for the different possible exchange statistics of the particles.\\
We can then describe the evolution of the wave function for the system via unitary transformations induced from the element of the fundamental group corresponding to particles word-lines. In mathematical terms this corresponds to a representation of $\pi_1(\mathrm{C})$. \\
If space-time has $D=3+1$ dimensions, the topological class of paths is completely determined by the corresponding permutation of the particles, because there are no knots in $4$ dimensions. Therefore the evolution of the system under particle exchanges will be described by a representation of the symmetric group $S_n$.
In $2+1$ dimensions we have more exotic behaviour, as the paths in configuration space can braid. The time evolution of the wave function is then described by a representation of the braid group on $n$ strands, denoted $B_n$.
\begin{definition}[Braid group]
	The braid group on $n$ strands $B_n$ is the group generated by $\{ \sigma_i: i=1,..,n-1\}$  satisfying the following relations:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\sigma_i \sigma_j = \sigma_j \sigma_i$ for $i+1 < j$
		\item $ \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1} \sigma_i = \sigma_{i+1} \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1}$ for $1 < i < n$.
	\end{itemize}
	The second relation is called Yang-Baxter equation and can be drawn as follows:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
	\node (0) at (0.5,0.5) {};
	\node (1) at (-0.1,-0.4) {$i-1$};
	\node (2) at (1,-0.4) {$i$};
	\node (3) at (2.1,-0.4) {$i+1$};

	\draw (1,0)--(0,1)--(0,2)--(5)--(1,3);

	\begin{gathered}

	\draw (0,0)--(0,1)--(4)--(5)--(2,3);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Abelian case
\end{itemize}
We say the system is abelian if the wave function lives in a one-dimensional representation of the group of paths in configuration space. In $3+1$ dimensions, this means we have to consider the one-dimensional representations of $S_N$. Note that there are only two possibilities (namely the trivial and the sign representations) corresponding to the two possible types of particle statistics in $3+1$ dimensions (Bose and Fermi statistics respectively).
In $2+1$ dimensions we have many more possibilities as the evolution of the wave function will be described by a one-dimensional representation of the braid group $B_N$. There are infinitely many one dimensional representations of the braid group connecting the fermions and bosons case. These are described by a single parameter $\theta$. Only one parameter because using Yang-Baxter we can show that all $N$ phases have to be the same, also can show $\theta$ has to be a fraction from physical considerations. We obtain abelian anyons.\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-abelian case
\end{itemize}
In the non-abelian case, the wave function lives in a higher-dimensional representation of In $3+1$ dimensions we don't get anything more than bosons and fermions if we also want to consider creation, annihilation (splitting, fusion) of particles (Doplicher-Roberts theorem). 
In $2+1$ dimensions we obtain degeneracy, non-abelian anyons, braidings give all unitaries.\\~\\
In the previous section, we only considered groups of symmetries of a Hamiltonian. In order take topological symmetries of a system into account, we need the more general framework of Hopf Algebras. In particular, as those symmetries arise from braids, we need quasitriangular hopf algebras (or quantum groups) to treat all symmetries on the same level. We will see that the universal $R$-matrix plays an important role in the description of topological dependencies.

\subsection{Models of anyons}
We want to construct a category $\cat$ that models the behaviour of anyons. Ojects of $\cat$ will correspond to quantum systems and morphisms to their possible evolutions, or to the processes we can perform on them.\\
Let us first set a finite set of labels $I = \{a,b,c...\}$ of distinct particle types, these will be objects of $\cat$. In our theory we must be able to consider many particles at the same time, so $\cat$ must be monoidal \cite{Coecke17}. The unit of the tensor $\mathbf{1}$ corresponds to the vacuum particle type (or "no-particle") and must be within our labels. So for the moment our theory is a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ and we can already use the diagrammatic language. A particle of type $a$ evolving trivially in time is denoted:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7, decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\node (a) at (0.3,0) {$a$};
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0,-1) to (0,1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Where we have adopted the convention that time flows upwards.\\
Two particles of types $a$ and $b$ can fuse to a third particle of type $c$. So we have fusion morphisms:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\node (a) at (-0.5,-0.5) {$a$};
	\node (b) at (0.5,-0.5) {$b$};
	\node (c) at (0.3,0.5) {$c$};
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (-0.5,-1) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0.5,-1) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0,0) to (0,1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Similarly a particle $c$ can split to give two particles $a$ and $b$. And $\cat$ contains splitting morphism:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{<}}}]
	\node (a) at (-0.5,0.5) {$a$};
	\node (b) at (0.5,0.5) {$b$};
	\node (c) at (0.3,-0.5) {$c$};
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (-0.5,1) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0.5,1) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0,0) to (0,-1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Any particle $a$ in quantum physics comes with its antiparticle $a^*$ which we can picture as a particle of type $a$ travelling backwards in time.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7, decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{<}}}]
	\node (a) at (0.3,0) {$a$};
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0,-1) to (0,1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
It has the property of fusing to the vacuum when it encounters $a$. Dually the vacuum can yield a particle-antiparticle pair, so we have cups and caps morphisms
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{<}}}]
	\draw [bend right=90, looseness=1.6, postaction = decorate] (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\quad
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{<}}}]
	\draw [bend left=90, looseness=1.6, postaction = decorate] (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\quad
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\draw [bend right=90, looseness=1.6, postaction = decorate] (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\quad
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\draw [bend left=90, looseness=1.6, postaction = decorate] (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Categorically this corresponds to a rigid structure on $\cat$, where we have assumed that every object has two-sided duals. We will also assume the category is well behaved: it is spherical and $1^*=1$. This allows us to define the quantum numbers for each particle type $a$ to be the following scalar:
\begin{equation}
d_a := tr(id_a) =
\begin{gathered}
\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{<}}}]
\node (a) at (0.7,0) {$a$};
\draw [bend left=90, looseness=1.6, postaction = decorate] (0.5,0) to (-0.5,0);
\draw [bend left=90, looseness=1.6, postaction = decorate] (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
At this point we need to linearise the theory to take superpositions into account. This means we make $\cat$ into a rigid tensor category (see appendix). We have biproducts $\oplus$ to account for superpositions. In order for the fusions to behave well with superpositions we must require that our labels for particle types be simple objects in the category and all objects to decompose as direct sums of simple ones, we say $\cat$ is semisimple. 
\begin{definition}[Fusion category]
	A fusion category is a finite semisimple k-linear tensor category with two sided duals
\end{definition}
At this point, our category $\mathcal{C}$ is a spherical fusion category  and the fusion rules look like this:
\begin{equation}
a \otimes b \simeq \oplus_c N_{ab}^c c
\end{equation}
Where $N_{ab}^c \in \mathbb{N}$. This defines a matrix for any $a$ simple indexed by simple objects $i,j \in I$:
$$(N_a)_{i,j} = N^a_{ij}$$
We can also define the dimension of the theory $\cat$ as the following scalar:
$$dim(\cat) = \sum_{i\in I} d_i^2$$
Given the fusion structure we can define the $F$-matrix which contains the information of the fusions interacting with the  quasi-associativity of the tensor product.
\begin{definition}[F-matrix]
	Given particles types $a$,$b$,$c$ we have two ways of fusing them to obtain particle type $e$, the matrix $F_{abc}^e$ is the change of basis matrix:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[ decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\node (a) at (-0.5,-0.3) {$a$};
	\node (b) at (0.5,-0.3) {$b$};
	\node (c) at (1.6,-0.3) {$c$};
	\node (d) at (0,0.3) {$d$};
	\node (e) at (0.3,0.7) {$e$};
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (-0.5,-0.5) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0.5,-0.5) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0,0) to (0.5,0.5);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (1.5,-0.5) to (0.5,0.5);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\, = \,
	\sum_{f\in I} (F_{abc}^e)_{df}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[ decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\node (a) at (-0.5,-0.3) {$a$};
	\node (b) at (0.5,-0.3) {$b$};
	\node (c) at (1.6,-0.3) {$c$};
	\node (d) at (0.9,0.4) {$f$};
	\node (e) at (0.3,0.7) {$e$};
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (1.5,-0.5) to (1,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0.5,-0.5) to (1,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (1,0) to (0.5,0.5);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (-0.5,-0.5) to (0.5,0.5);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
The possibilities for the $F$-matrices are constrained by the pentagon axiom of a monoidal category, it corresponds to a matrix representation of the associators.
We still have one important question to ask to the theory, what happens when the position of two particles is exchanged? To answer this question the theory must have a braided structure and we obtain a braided fusion category. The braided structure determines the long-distance, topological interactions between particles. Braided fusion categories induce representations of the braid group $B_n$, given our discussion at the beginning of this chapter, we see that they are very good candidates for describing theories of anyons. 
The braided structure is captured by the following piece of data:
\begin{definition}[$R$-matrix]
	Given particle types $a$, $b$ and $c$ the matrix $R_{ab}^c$ is defined by:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\node (a) at (-0.5,-0.6) {$a$};
	\node (b) at (0.5,-0.6) {$b$};
	\node (c) at (0.3,0.5) {$c$};
	\node (0) at (0,-0.5) {};
	\draw [ bend left=50, looseness=1.8] (0) to (0,0);
	\draw [ bend right=50, looseness=1.8] (0,-0.5) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (-0.5,-1) to (0,-0.5);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0.5,-1) to (0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0,0) to (0,1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\, = R_{ab}^c \, 
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\node (a) at (-0.5,-0.5) {$a$};
	\node (b) at (0.5,-0.5) {$b$};
	\node (c) at (0.3,0.5) {$c$};
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (-0.5,-1) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0.5,-1) to (0,0);
	\draw [postaction = decorate] (0,0) to (0,1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
From the first section we know that sphericality of the theory, interacting with the braided structure yields a ribbon structure. The twist $\theta$ has physical significance, it can be seen as a rotation of the particle and in most interesting cases it will be non-trivial.\\
In the case of abelian anyons, the twist is just a global phase, if we denote by $h_a$ the topological spin of the particle then $\theta_a = e^{2\pi i h_a}$ is the twist factor of $a$. In this scenario, the $R$-matrices are scalars and it is easy to see, using the definition of the twist, that the $R$ coefficients and the twist factors are related by:
$$R_{ab}^c R_{ba}^c = \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a \theta_b}$$
These coefficients are also constrained by the hexagon axiom of braided monoidal categories. One way to build theories of abelian anyons, is to construct $R$ matrices, twist factors and $F$ matrices which satisfy both hexagon and pentagon axioms. However, these constraints do not fix $R$ and $F$ uniquely. 
\begin{example}[G-graded vector spaces]
	Suppose we start from a set of labels and define the fusions to form a group. $1$ is the identity particle type, for any particle type $a$, $a^*$ will be its inverse. We have defined the skeleton of a spherical fusion category, which we obtain by linearising, i.e taking a fiber functor to $Vect$. We obtain the category $Vec_G$, of $G$ graded vector spaces over $\mathbb{C}$.
	The category $Vec_G$ for $G$ a group is a symmetric spherical fusion category. Linearity and tensor are given by the underlying $Vect$ structure, simple objects $V_g$ are one-dimensional and indexed by elements $g \in G$, duality is proved by using the group inverse and fusions are given by the group multiplication.
	$$V_g \otimes V_h \simeq V_{gh}$$
	In this case both the $F$ and $R$ matrices are trivial.\\
	Tannaka duality hints that this should be a category of representations and indeed it is easy to show that $Vec_G \simeq Rep(Func(G))$ where $Func(G)$ is the function algebra on $G$.\\
	For $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$ we have two irreducible representations $\tau_+$ and $\tau_-$, both one dimensional with the obvious fusion rules given by the cyclic group of order $2$.\\
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
	If $H$ is a finite dimensional, semisimple, quasitriangular Hopf algebra, then $Rep(H)$ is a braided fusion category and $dim(Rep(H))=dim(H)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	The proof is given by [find citation]
\end{proof}
This proposition gives us a way of building theories of anyons from hopf algebras.\\
The first example that comes to mind is that of a group algebra $\mathbb{C}G$. So let us suppose the theory is described by the category $RepG$. 
First consider the object $V= \mathbb{C}G$. It is known that $\mathbb{C}G \simeq \oplus_{i \in I} X_i \otimes X_i^*$. Simple objects $X_i$ correspond to particle types so $V$ can be seen as the completely mixed state. This object (i.e the vector space with it's $G$-action) carries all the information of the theory (remember tannaka duality) and indeed we could study the theory by just considering this algebra. We can think of elements of $G$ as particle subtypes, particle types correspond to conjugacy classes, a state $v \in V$ is a superposition of particle subtypes. The action of $G$ permutes the basis vectors, and precisely corresponds to fusion. So acting with $g \in G$ on a state $v \in V$ corresponds to fusing a particle of type $g$ with one that is in a superposition $v$ of particle types.\\
In the case where $G$ is abelian all irreducible representations are one dimensional, each corresponding to an element of the group. So really $Rep(G) \simeq Vec_G$ and behaves exactly like $\mathbb{C}G$ (without distinction between particle types and subtypes). This case is perhaps interesting philosophically as the representations of our symmetries have the same structure as the symmetries themselves [cite majid self-duality]. From a computational perspective it is a trivial situation, as only classical processes can be performed (no entanglement is possible).\\
If $G$ is not abelian we must have a higher dimensional irreducible representation of $G$. So we could obtain more interesting processes but from a topological quantum perspective it remains a trivial case as no computational power can be obtained from the braided structure. This is because $RepG$ is symmetric as we have seen in the first section. Physically, we have seen that symmetric exchange of particles applies to fermions and bosons, from a topological perspective those types of particles can be seen as degenerate cases of anyons.
Groups are therefore not enough to describe interesting anyon theories. In the next section we pin down a smaller class of categories which correspond to non-degenerate theories of anyons.


\subsection{Modular categories}
In this section we  define modular categories and state a few results that we will use in the next section. As we have seen, braided fusion categories are well suited to describe theories of anyons. These form a big class of categories, some of which are uninteresting from the physical point of view. To distinguish between them we can place braided fusion categories in a spectrum by asking what their symmetric center $Z_2$ is. 

\begin{definition}[Symmetric center]
	If $\cat$ is a monoidal category, the symmetric center $Z_2(\mathcal{C})$ is the full subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$ defined by:
	$$ obj \, Z_2(\mathcal{C}) = \{ X\in \mathcal{C} : c_{X,Y} \circ c_{Y,X} = id_{Y\otimes X} \quad \forall Y \in \mathcal{C} \} $$
\end{definition}
It is easy to see that $\cat$ is symmetric iff $Z_2(\cat)=\cat$.
\begin{definition}[Modular categories]
	A braided fusion category is:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item pre-modular if it is spherical,
		\item non-degenerate if $Z_2(\mathcal{C})$ is trivial (i.e it only contains direct sums of the tensor unit as objects, i.e every simple object is isomorphic to the tensor unit)
		\item modular if it is pre-modular and non-degenerate.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
The two opposite ends of this spectrum are symmetric fusion categories on one side (such that $Z_2(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{C}$) and modular tensor categories (as defined). 
In the first case, we have only symmetric exchange of quantum systems which means all particles in the theory are either bosons or fermions. Such categories exhibit no topological behaviour. Modular categories are the opposite situation, the theory doesn't contain any bosons or fermions but only non-degenerate anyons (i.e anyons with non-trivial twist). Modular categories are very well-behaved theories as we can assign to them the so called modular $S$-matrix which will contain all the information on fusion rules as well as the braided structure.

\begin{definition}[$S$-matrix]
	Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a spherical braided fusion category and let $I$ be the set of isomorphism classes of simple objects in $\mathcal{C}$. We define $S_{i,j}$ for $i,j \in I$ to be the following:
	\begin{equation}
	S_{i,j} := tr(B_{X_j,X_i} \circ B_{X_i, X_j}) =
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8, decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\node (0) at (0,0) {};
	\node (1) at (0, 1) {};
	\node (2) at (0.6,-0.9) {$X_j$};
	\node (3) at (-0.6,-0.9) {$X_i$};
	\draw (-0.5,-0.5)--(0.5, 0.5)--(1)--(-0.5,1.5);
	\draw (0.5,-0.5)--(0)--(-0.5,0.5)--(0.5,1.5);
	\draw [bend right=90, looseness=1.5, postaction=decorate] (-0.5,1.5) to (-0.5,-0.5);
	\draw [bend left=90, looseness=1.5, postaction=decorate] (0.5,1.5) to (0.5,-0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Note that it doesn't matter on which side we take the trace by sphericality.
\end{remark} 
\begin{definition}[$T$-matrix]
	Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a spherical braided fusion category, we define the $T$ matrix (indexed by $I$) given by 
	\begin{equation}
	T_{i,j} := \delta_{i,j} tr(B_{X_i,X_j}) = \delta_{i,j}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8, decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\node (0) at (0,0) {};
	\node (2) at (0.6,-0.9) {$X_j$};
	\node (3) at (-0.6,-0.9) {$X_i$};
	\draw (-0.5,-0.5)--(0.5, 0.5);
	\draw (0.5,-0.5)--(0)--(-0.5,0.5);
	\draw [bend right=90, looseness=1.5, postaction=decorate] (-0.5,0.5) to (-0.5,-0.5);
	\draw [bend left=90, looseness=1.5, postaction=decorate] (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,-0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\end{equation}	
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Categories of this type are called modular as it can be shown that $S$ and $T$ satisfy the same relations as the generators of the modular group $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, so that any modular category induces a representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. It is a conjecture that the $S$ ant $T$ matrices determine modular categories up to ribbon equivalence.
\end{remark} 
\begin{definition}[Mueger centralizer]
	If $\mathcal{D}$ is a full (tensor) subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$ can define $C_\cat(D)$ to be the full subcategory such that 
	$$obj(C_\cat(D))=\{X \in obj(\mathcal{C}): B_{X,Y} \circ B_{Y,X} = id_{X \otimes Y}\}$$
\end{definition}
It is easy to check this is indeed a monoidal subcategory and it is replete (i.e closed under isomorphisms) \cite{Mueger02}. Also note that $Z_2(\cat) = C_\cat(\cat)$.
The following result is one of the most important pure category theoretic results on modular categories. We will need it for the discussion on the Drinfeld center.
\begin{theorem}[Mueger decomposition] \label{muegerdec}
	Let $\cat$ be a modular category and $\mathcal{K}$ a semisimple full tensor subcategory, then there is an equivalence of braided fusion categories:
	$$ \cat \simeq \mathcal{K} \boxtimes C_\cat(\mathcal{K}) $$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	This theorem was proved by Mueger in 2002 \cite{Mueger02}.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
	$\mathcal{C}$ is modular iff the $S$-matrix is invertible.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\cat$ is not modular, then $Z_2(\cat)$ is non-trivial $\implies$ there is a non-trivial simple object $a$ such that its braiding is the symmetry. Therefore $S_{a,i}=d_a d_i$ for all $i \in I$, but also $S_{1,i}= d_i$ and so the first and $a$th rows of $S$ are proportional $\implies$ $S$ is not invertible.\\
	The other direction is less easy and can be found in \cite{Bakalov00} and \cite{Mueger02}.
\end{proof}
We also state the following result which is proved in \cite{Bakalov00}.
\begin{proposition}
	The modular $S$-matrix diagonalises the $N$-matrix.
\end{proposition}
Therefore the $S$-matrix contain all the information of the fusion rules, and with some algebraic manipulation (which can be found in \cite{Bakalov00}) we obtain the well-known Verlinde formula for the fusion coefficients:
\begin{equation}
N_{ij}^k = \sum_{r\in I} \frac{S_{ir}S_{jr}S_{kr}}{S_{1r}}
\end{equation}
\begin{remark}
	Given any modular category we can use the Turaev-Viro construction \cite{Balsam12}, which yields a $2+1$ topological quantum field theory. For our purposes we only need to view the modular category as a process theory of anyons in the sense of \cite{Abramsky04} and we won't introduce the $TQFT$ formalism.

\begin{example}[Fibonacci anyons]
	The category $Fib$ of Fibonacci anyons is one of the most popular examples of modular categories as it have a purely algebraic formulation. Anyons of this type are non-abelian and complete for topological quantum computation \cite{Panangaden11}. We will meet them again in the next chapter.\\
	$Fib$ has only two simple objects: $\tau$ and the vacuum type $1$. The fusion rules are given by:
	$$ 1 \otimes \tau = \tau = \tau \otimes 1$$
	$$ \tau \otimes \tau = 1 \oplus \tau $$ 
	It turns out that those equations together with the hexagon and pentagon constraints completely determine a modular category \cite{Simon16}.
\end{example}


\subsection{The Drinfeld center}
In this section we introduce a general construction that turns braided fusion categories into modular categories, and we show its relationship with the Quantum double construction on a Hopf Algebra introduced in the first chapter.\\
Topological dependencies between objects in fusion categories are captured by the braided structure. Let us fix some definitions before discussing the Drinfeld construction.
\begin{definition}[Half-braiding]
	A half-braiding on some object $X$ in a monoidal category $\cat$ is a natural isomorphism 
	$$ e^X : X \otimes (-) \Rightarrow (-) \otimes X$$
	satisfying the compatibility condition:
	$$e^X_{Y \otimes Z} = (id_Y \otimes e^X_Z) \circ ( e^X_Y \otimes id_Z) $$ 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Drinfeld center]
	The braided (Drinfeld) center of a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ is the category $Z(\mathcal{C})$ with objects pairs $(X,e^X)$ where $X \in \mathcal{C}$ and $e^X$ is a half-braiding, and with morphisms given by the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ which commute with the half-braiding.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Yetter-Drinfeld modules]
	Let $H$ be a bialgebra, the category $\mathcal{D}_{H}^{lr}$ is the category of left-right Yetter-Drinfeld modules where objects are left $H$-modules which are simultaneously right $H$-comodules satisfying the following compatibility condition:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[whit/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}, squr/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=black}]
	\node [scale=0.5, whit] (0) at (0,-0.3) {};
	\node [scale=0.5, squr] (3) at (0,0.3) {};
	\node [scale=0.5, draw, circle, fill=black] (1) at (0.5,0.3) {};
	\node [scale=0.5, draw, circle, fill=white] (2) at (-0.5,-0.3) {};
	\draw (-0.5,-0.7)--(2)--(1)--(0.5,0.7);
	\draw [bend left] (2) to (3);
	\draw [bend right] (0) to (1);
	\draw (0,-0.7)--(0)--(3)--(0,0.7);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}
	\, = \,
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[whit/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}, squr/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=black}]
	\node [scale=0.5, whit] (0) at (-0.3,0.3) {};
	\node [scale=0.5, squr] (3) at (0.3,-0.3) {};
	\node [scale=0.5, draw, circle, fill=black] (1) at (0.3,0.5) {};
	\node [scale=0.5, draw, circle, fill=white] (2) at (-0.3,-0.5) {};
	\draw (-0.3,-0.7)--(2)--(1)--(0.3,0.7);
	\draw (2) to (3);
	\draw (0) to (1);
	\draw (-0.3,0.7)--(0);
	\draw[bend right] (0) to (0,0);
	\draw[bend left] (0,0) to (3);
	\draw (3)--(0.3,-0.7);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered}	
	\end{equation}
	where the white box denotes the $H$ coaction and the black box defines the right coaction. Morphisms of $\mathcal{D}_{H}^{lr}$ are both $H$-module and $H$-comodule morphisms. Left-left Yetter-Drinfeld modules are defined in the obvious way and form a category $\mathcal{D}_{H}^{ll}$. The compatibility condition then looks like this:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[whit/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=white}, squr/.style={draw,regular polygon,
		regular polygon sides=4,fill=black}]

	\draw (0,-0.7)--(3)--(0)--(0,0.7);

	\end{gathered}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
	Let $\cat$ be a monoidal category, then $Z(\cat)$ is braided monoidal.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}	
	It is easy to check that defining the tensor as $(X \otimes Y, e^{X \otimes Y}_Z= (e^X_Z \otimes id_Y) \circ (id_X \otimes e^Y(Z))$
	and the braiding as $e^X_Y$ yields a braided monoidal structure on $Z(\cat)$.
\end{proof}
The following proposition hints to the relationship between the Drinfeld center and the quantum double.
\begin{proposition}
	The Drinfeld center of a spherical fusion category is modular.
	And $dim(Z(\cat)) = dim(\cat)^2$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Proof is given by \cite{Mueger02}.
\end{proof}
In general $Z(\cat)$ is not symmetric as we will see, but in the case of $Vect$ the Drinfeld construction is trivial.
\begin{proposition}
	$Z(Vect) \simeq Vect$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Using the Mueger decomposition \ref{muegerdec}, note that $Z(Vect)$ is modular and $Vect$ is a full fusion subcategory of $Z(Vect)$, therefore 
	$$Z(Vect) \simeq Vect \boxtimes C_{Z(Vect)}(Vect)$$
	But if $(A, e^A)$ is an object of $C_{Z(Vect)}(Vect)$ then any component $e^A_B$ must be the inverse of the symmetry morphism on $A\otimes B$ $\implies$ it must be the symmetry morphism $\implies$  $C_{Z(Vect)}(Vect)	\simeq Vect$ and so $Z(Vect) \simeq Vect$
\end{proof} 
Fix a bialgebra $H$ and suppose $ \left( V, \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5, squr/.style={draw,regular polygon,
	regular polygon sides=4,fill=black}]
\node [scale=0.3, squr] (0) at (0,0.4) {};
\draw (0,0)--(0)--(0,0.7);
\draw[bend left] (-0.4,0) to (0);
\end{tikzpicture} \, \right) \,
\in obj(Rep(H))$ and $(V, e_V)$ is in $Z(RepG)$.
Note that $H$ has a natural $H$-module structure given by right multiplication. Consider the component of the half-braiding of $H$ at $V$.
\begin{center}	
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (0,0) {};
	\node (1) at (-0.7, -0.7) {$H$};
	\node (2) at (0.7, -0.7) {$V$};
	\draw (1)--(0.5,0.5);
	\draw (2)--(0)--(-0.5,0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
In the arguments that follow we will use repeatedly the following trick which we state as a Lemma, it exploits the copy of $Vect$ which lives inside any category of representations.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma}
	For any $W$ object of $Rep(H)$ with white action and $V$ with half braiding.

	\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Note that 
	$\left( H\otimes W, \,
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5, whit/.style={draw,regular polygon,

	is in $Rep(H)$ and
	\begin{equation*}

	\node[scale=0.5, whit] (0) at (0,0) {};
	\draw (0,-0.5)--(0)--(0,0.5);
	\draw [bend left] (-0.5,-0.5) to (0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered} : 
	\left( H\otimes W, \,
	\begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]

	\draw [bend left] (-0.5,-0.5) to (0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered} \,\right)
	\end{equation*} 
	is an intertwiner by the module law.
	Also it is easy to check that the symmetry morphism lifted from $Vect$ 
	$$
	\left( W, \, \begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
	\draw (0,-0.5)--(0,0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered} \,\right)
	\otimes V 
	\rightarrow 
	V \otimes \left( W, \, \begin{gathered}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
	\draw (0,-0.5)--(0,0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{gathered} \,\right) $$ 
	is an intertwiner. And it follows from $Z(Vect)=Vect$ that it must be the $W$-component (where $W$ has the trivial action) of the half braiding on $V$ as $W$ lives in the copy of $Vect$ in $Rep(H)$.
\end{proof}

Define a right coaction of $H$ on $V$:

We have defined a functor $F_1: Z(Rep(H)) \rightarrow \mathcal{D}_H^{lr}$ which is identity on arrows and sends $(V,e_V)$ to the left-right Yetter-Drinfeld module with black $H$ action and white $H$ coaction. To see that it is well defined to say it is identity on arrows (and so faithful) note that if an $H$-module morphism $f$ is in $Z(Rep(H))$ then it commutes with the half-brading, in particular it commutes with the $H$-component of the half-braiding and therefore it commutes with the $H$-coaction as defined.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Similarly we can define a functor $F_2: Z(Rep(H)) \rightarrow \mathcal{D}_H^{ll}$ by considering the $H$ component of the half braiding on $V$ and defining the following left-coaction:

	$(\Longleftarrow)$ is straightforward.
	To show $(\implies)$ set $W=H$ with the natural left module structure given by left multiplication, then inserting the unit state \unit on the left of the tensor we obtain the required identity.
\end{proof}
And we say that if $H$ is a hopf algebra with a skew antipode we can make the right hand sides hold imposing:

	Now it is easy to see that morphisms commute with the $DH$-action iff they commute with the $H$-action and $H$-coaction. So we have defined a fully faithful embedding of $\mathcal{D}_H^{ll}$ into $Rep(DH)$. To see it is essentially surjective note that, given a $DH$-action on $V$, we can recover the $H$-action by plugging the counit in the $H^\star$ component of the $DH$-action and the $H$-coaction by plugging the unit in the $H$-component and bending the $H^\star$ wire up. It remains to check that those indeed define a left-left Yetter-Drinfeld module in all cases, i.e that the compatibility condition is satisfied. And it is indeed the case:

We have found many equivalent ways of constructing non-degenerate theories of anyons. In the next section we will use the simplest examples induced by groups, justified by the following proposition
\begin{proposition}
	If $G$ is a finite non-abelian group then $Rep(D(G))$ is modular.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	A direct proof is given in the third chapter of \cite{Bakalov00}. But this also follows from the fact that $Z(Rep(G))$ is modular.

\section{Quantum Computation}

\subsection{Topological Quantum Computation}

\subsubsection{From categories to computation}
In the previous section we saw that categories can be interpreted as physical process theories. In a very similar way, we can interpret objets as data types and morphisms as computational processes, so that any category corresponds to a theory of computation. Monoidal categories are ones where parallel computation is possible. Quantum computation is a model in which data is encoded in the state of quantum systems (particles) and processes are quantum transformations of the system. A computation consists of the preparation of some quantum states, their manipulation and measurement. This procedure is repeated in order to collect statistics and approximate density distributions. The unit of information in quantum computation is called qubit by analogy with the classical bit. A qubit is a two-level quantum system, that is a Hilbert space of dimension $2$ which is denote by $\mathbb{C}^2$\\
Modular categories are models for topological quantum computation (TQC) in the sense of \cite{Kitaev03} or \cite{Rowell17}. TQC has been studied extensively in recent years as it allows for fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this model data is encoded in non-abelian anyons and quantum gates are obtained by braiding those particles. Topologically equivalent braids implement the same quantum process so that small perturbations of particle world-lines do not affect the computation and gates are topologically protected from decoherence.
Another reason for studying topological quantum computation is that some TQC models allow to approximate the Jones polynomial in polynomial time, a problem that is believed to be untractable classically (it is in the complexity class $\# P$) .\\
The problem of building a topological quantum computer has been addressed by various authors \cite{Kitaev03} [cite freedman]. The difficulty arises in the two-dimensional nature of anyons. Indeed those are only known to arise as quasi-particle excitations on two-dimensional fluids at low temperature, an experimentally difficult setup which was never achieved for non-abelian excitations.\\
A topological quantum computer runs as follows \cite{Rowell17}:
\begin{definition}[TQC]
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Creation of anyon pairs from the vacuum to encode the information as a quantum state.
		\item Braiding those anyons performs a quantum gate on the state.
		\item fusing neighbouring anyons and observing the resulting anyon type corresponds to a projective measurement on the system.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
The computation result is the approximation to a probability distribution (over measurement outcomes) obtained by repeating the procedure polynomially many times and recording the output anyon types. Note that if we postselct on the vacuum sector to be the output anyon type we are effetively approximating an invariant of links. Indeed any process in TQC starting and ending in the vacuum sector is a link, formed by the particle trajectories in space-time (i.e the briading process). The time evolution of the system $V$ must be a unitary operator, so that any braiding process on $n$ particles induces the evaluation of some representation $\beta \rightarrow U_\beta$ of the braid group $B_n$.\\
In order to make sure the braiding process is a unitary transformation of the state space we will impose one further constraint on our categorical model of computation: unitarity of the braids in the modular category in question.\\
Take the fusion space to be our computational hilbert space.\\
Topological qudits are usually encoded as fusion tree basis elements\\
Topologial gates: braids (can express as action of the braid group) + measurements (=fusions and associators).

\subsubsection{Fibonacci anyons}
We now look back at example [ref] on Fibonacci anyons and show how to compute in the model.
Recall we have only two particle types: the vacuum sector $1$ and the non-trivial $\tau$ such that:
$$\tau \otimes \tau = 1 \oplus \tau$$
$\tau$ and $1$ are their own anti-particles so we don't need to distinguish particles and antiparticles by wrinting arrows on wires.
We can write the basis of the two dimensional space $\tau \otimes \tau$ as:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (0.3, 0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (-0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\draw (-0.5, -0.5)--(0,0)--(0,0.5);
	\draw (0.5, -0.5)--(0,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\quad
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (0.3, 0.3) {$1$};
	\node (0) at (-0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\draw (-0.5, -0.5)--(0,0)--(0,0.5);
	\draw (0.5, -0.5)--(0,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The fusion space $V_{\tau^{\otimes 3}}^\tau$ is two dimensional, we will take it as our computational space and write the computational basis as:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (0.1, 0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (-0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.6, 0.8) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (1.6, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\draw (-0.5, -0.5)--(0,0)--(0.5,0.5)--(1,1);
	\draw (0.5, -0.5)--(0,0);
	\draw (1.5, -0.5)--(0.5,0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\quad
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (0.1, 0.3) {$1$};
	\node (0) at (-0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.6, 0.8) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (1.6, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\draw (-0.5, -0.5)--(0,0)--(0.5,0.5)--(1,1);
	\draw (0.5, -0.5)--(0,0);
	\draw (1.5, -0.5)--(0.5,0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Let's denote by $\ket{0}, \ket{1}$ these basis states. Another basis is given by fusing the left-most two anyons first:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (1, 0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (-0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.5, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.6, 0.8) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (1.6, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\draw (-0.5, -0.5)--(0,0)--(0.5,0.5)--(1,1);
	\draw (0.5, -0.5)--(1,0);
	\draw (1.5, -0.5)--(0.5,0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\quad
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (0) at (1, 0.3) {$1$};
	\node (0) at (-0.7, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.5, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (0.6, 0.8) {$\tau$};
	\node (0) at (1.6, -0.3) {$\tau$};
	\draw (-0.5, -0.5)--(0,0)--(0.5,0.5)--(1,1);
	\draw (0.5, -0.5)--(1,0);
	\draw (1.5, -0.5)--(0.5,0.5);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
And we denote them by $\ket{+}, \ket{-}$. These two bases are linked by a unitary $2 \times 2$ transformation $F:= F^\tau_{\tau^{\otimes 3}}$ given by the solution of the following system:
$$ \ket{0} = F_{0+} \ket{+} + F_{0-} \ket{-}$$
$$ \ket{1} = F_{1+} \ket{+} + F_{1-} \ket{-}$$
To derive the form of the $F$-matrix we need to consider the pentagon axiom. It turns out that for the Fibonacci model the pentagon is enough to derive the $F$-matrix but it is not the case in general. The resulting $F$-matrix is \cite{Simon16}:
\begin{center}
	$\begin{bmatrix}
	\phi^{-1} & \phi^{-\frac{1}{2}} \\
	\phi^{-\frac{1}{2}} & -\phi^{-1}
	\end{bmatrix}$
\end{center}
where $\phi = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.

\subsubsection{Kitaev's quantum double model}
Fix a group $G$, and suppose we have particles living in state space $\mathbb{C}G$ (the group agebra). We will build a special case of Kitaev's quantum double model \cite{Kitaev03}, in order to see directly the connection with the category $Rep(DG)$.\\
First of all let us consider 4 types of linear operators on $\mathbb{C}G$: $L^g_\pm$, $T^h_\pm$ (using the notation from \cite{Kitaev03}). Indexed by elements $g,h \in G$, and defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
L^g_+ \ket{z} = \ket{gz} \quad& L^g_- \ket{z} = \ket{zg^{-1}}\\
T^h_+ \ket{z} = \delta_{h,z} \ket{z} \quad& T^h_- \ket{z} = \delta_{h^{-1},z} \ket{z}
\end{aligned}	 
\end{equation}
Now, consider the trivial lattice on a torus with particles on the edges, i.e a square with opposite edges identified as follows:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={markings,mark=at position 0.5 with {\arrow{>}}}]
	\draw (0,0)--(0,1);
	\draw (1,0)--(1,1);
	\draw[blue] (0,1)--(1,1);
	\draw[blue] (0,0)--(1,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
For the moment take this lattice as our system, note that states are generated by pairs of elements of $G$, each labelling one edge of the lattice. Let's say that $L^g_\pm(0)$, $L^g_\pm(1)$ and $T^h_\pm(0)$ $T^h_\pm(1)$ are $L_\pm$ and $T_\pm$ operators acting on the first and second particle. Note that in this configuration, we have only one plaquette and one vertex, we will only need to define two types of operators on the lattice, indexed by elements of $G$. For $g,h \in G$ define:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A_g &= L^g_+(0) L^g_+(1) L^g_-(0) L^g_-(1)\\
P_h &= \sum_{h_1h_2h_3h_4=h} T^{h_1}_+(0) T^{h_2}_+(1) T^{h_3}_-(0) T^{h_4}_-(1)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
From a physical point of view $P_h$ operators can be understood as measuring the magnetic flux of the system and $A_g$ are symmetry transformations on the charge. Flux measurements are projection $P_h \in \mathbb{C}G^*$ onto flux sector $h$. The allowed residual global symmetry transformations are then implemented via $A_g$ for $g \in N(h)$. \\
Naturally the projectors form a Von Neumann family and satisfy 
$$P_hP_{h'}= \delta_{h,h'} P_h.$$ 
Operators $A_g$ are global symmetry transformation 
$$A_gA_h = A_gh$$
and affect the fluxes via conjugation:
\begin{equation}\label{doublemult}
A_gP_h = P_{ghg^{-1}}A_g
\end{equation}
(this was shown was shown by Kitaev \cite{Kitaev03}). Operators $A_g$ and $P_h$ generate the algebra $DG$. So the quantum double construction allows to capture both global symmetry transformations and projective measurements in one algebraic structure. It is easy to check, rewriting the definition, that the following is true. 
\begin{proposition}
	For any finite group $G$, its quantum double $D(G)$ is the algebra generated by $\{P_hA_g\}_{h,g\in G}$ with multiplication induced by (\ref{doublemult}) comultiplication and antipode as defined in [first section]. 
\end{proposition}
$D(G)$ has a natural quasi-triangular structure witnessed by the universal R-matrix $R=\sum_{g,h \in G}P_he \otimes P_hg$, making $RepDG$ braided.\\
Kitaev then builds a Hamiltonian for the system and shows that the sectors of this Hamiltonian are precisely the irreducible representations of $DG$. Here we will skip this part of the reasoning and rely on the intuition that the operators $A_g$ and $P_h$ correspond to the symmetries of the system, i.e the dynamics which are `constantly being applied'. So the allowed processes of the systems are processes that commute with all of those operators, i.e the system lives in a representation of $DG$ and the allowed processes are intertwiners. We obtain the process theory $Rep(DG)$. Note that because we chose our lattice to be trivial, in the model as we described it the overall dimension of the system is at most $|G|^2$ and we cannot obtain higher dimensional representations. This issue was directly avoided by Kitaev in his presentation \cite{Kitaev03}, by allowing the lattice to be arbitrairy (embedded in some manifold) and defining $A_g$ and $P_h$ operators on sites (i.e vertices together with a plaquette). For each site $a=(s,p)$ where $s$ is a vertex and $p$ a plaquette, we have operators $A_g(a)$ and $P_h(a)$ which generate the quantum double algebra. An excitation is then a state of some non-trivial irreducible representation of $DG$ being created at some site $a$ on the lattice. Those excitations have anyonic behaviour. In what follows we will assume the lattice was `layered' enough so that we can create more than one excitation and we can move around without fusing them. If the lattice is big enough we have obtained a practical implementation of anyons whose behaviour is described by the modular category $Rep(DG)$. When $G$ is abelian, we only have abelian anyons which are very unlikely to be universal for quantum computation. It was shown by Kitaev that if $G=S_5$ the model is universal for quantum computation. In [cite Lahtinen] the $G=S_3$ model was considered but not shown to be universal.\\  
In order to understand the possible anyon types in the model induced by finite group $G$, we must study the irreducible representations of the quantum double finite group algebra $DG$. This has been done by Gould \cite{Gould93}, who showed that irreducible representations of $DG$ are obtained in the following way.\\
Let $\{C_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be the distinct conjugacy classes in $G$. To each of those conjugacy classes corresponds a centralizer subgroup $N_i$ (two choices of representatives for $C_i$ yield isomorphic centralizer subgroups). Then for any irreducible representation $(\alpha,V^i_\alpha)$ of $N_i$ with basis elements $v^\alpha_j$, let $V_{i,\alpha} = \mathbb{C}C_i \otimes V^i_\alpha$, this has basis $\{ \ket{k,v^\alpha_j} \}_{j=1,...,dim\alpha}^{k\in C_i}$ and forms an irreducible representation of $D(G)$ under the action 
\begin{equation}
P_hg\ket{k,v^\alpha_j} = \delta_{h,gkg^{-1}} \ket{h,\alpha(h^{-1}gk)v^\alpha_j}
\end{equation}
and the $\{V_{i,\alpha}\}$ is the complete set of irreducible representations.

\begin{example}[Kitaev's Toric code]
	The case where $G \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2$ gives rise to Kitaev's toric code. Note that $D(\mathbb{Z}_2) \simeq \mathbb{C}(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2^\star)$, so that there are $4$ irreducible representations, all of which are 1-dimensional. Each of those corresponds to a different type of excitation.  Let $x$ and $y$ be the generators of the group. The trivial representation is the trivial excitation (or `no excitation'). The other irreducible representations are obtained by mapping $x$ and $y$ to order $2$  elements of $\mathbb{C}$. We obtain two bosons, when both get sent to $-1$ or $i$ and one fermions when $x \mapsto -1$ and $y \mapsto i$. 
\end{example}

\subsection{Permutational Quantum Computing}
This section is about a model of quantum computation introduced by Jordan \cite{Jordan09}. We will first introduce the model as it appears in \cite{Jordan09} and then give a categorical presentation not present in the literature which will allow us to generalize the model and compare it to other computational models.

\subsubsection{Jordan's model}
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an $n$-qubit quantum system. Basis states of an $n$-qubit quantum systems are often specified by listing eigenvalues of Pauli-$Z$ operators applied to each qubit, which is known as computational basis.
Permutational quantum computing (PQC) works with another choice of basis states: eigenstates of complete set of commuting spin measurements on qubit subsets. Let us fix a finite set $I=\{1,2,3...,n\}$ indexing the qubits. With a convention that $\hbar = 1$, the spin of the $k$-th qubit is defined by a triple:
\begin{align*}
\vec{S}_k &= \frac{1}{2} \left( X_k, \, Y_k, \,Z_k \right),
\end{align*}
where $X_k$, $Y_k$ and $Z_k$ denote the Pauli $X$,$Y$ and $Z$ operators on the $k$-th qubit. The total spin operator of a qubit subset $A$  is given by:
\begin{align*}
S_A^2 &= \left( \sum_{k \in A} \vec{S}_k \right) \cdot  \left( \sum_{k \in A} \vec{S}_k \right)\,,
\end{align*} 
and we will use $S^2$ to denote the spin operator on the set of all qubits. 
Let 
$$Z_A = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k \in A} Z_k $$ 
denote the total $Z$-spin operator on qubit subset $A$ and we label by $Z$ the total $Z$-operator applied to all qubits (i.e $Z=Z_I$). $Z$ and $S^2$ commute and stabilize an eigenspaces labeled by quantum numbers $J$ and $M$: 
\begin{equation}
S^2  \ket{J, \, M} = J (J +1 ) \ket{J, \, M},  \\
Z \ket{J, \, M} = M \ket{J, \, M},
\end{equation} 
where $J$ is the total spin of all qubits and $M$ takes values $ -J \leq M \leq J$ in an integer steps. There are therefore $2J + 1$ $Z$-operator eigenstates for each $J$ and we will refer to this degeneracy as $M$-degeneracy. \\
Now, it is easy to see that the operators $S_A^2$ and $S_B^2$ on sets $A, B$ commute if and only if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint or one is subset of the other. We can therefore give a complete set of commuting operators on $I$:
\begin{equation} \label{comS}
S_{\lbrace12\rbrace}^2, \, S_{\lbrace123\rbrace}^2, \, \ldots S^2, \, Z
\end{equation}
In practice, this means that if we have $n$ qubits, measuring each of those operators yields a a sequence of outcomes $j_{12}, j_{123}, ... , J, M$ (the eigenvalues of each operator) which tests for some state of $\mathcal{J}$. Dually, allowing superselection on the outcomes of each measurement we have also defined a preparation recipe. This choice of basis states is known as \textit{sequential coupling}.\\
The $j$-quantum numbers on sets of qubits $A,B$ combine according to the angular addition rules \cite{Woit17}: 
\begin{align*}
|j_A - j_B| \leq j_{A \cup B} &\leq j_A + j_B, \\
j_{A \cup B} + j_A + j_B & \in \mathbb{Z},
\end{align*}
For example if $n=3$, there are two ways to obtain $J=\frac{1}{2}$ eigenstate of three spins - either by adding a qubit to a two-qubit singlet $(J=0)$ state, or by adding a qubit to a triplet $(J=1)$ \cite{Pauncz67}.
We can picture those states as labeled binary trees with $n$ leaves, which we refer to as labeled recoupling diagrams. For instance, for $n=3$ we have:

Note that the shape of those binary trees is induced by the choices (\ref{comS}). Every rooted binary tree shape with $n$ leaves (which we will refer to as recoupling diagram) yields a different choice of complete set of commuting observables, and therefore a different choice of basis for $\mathcal{L}$. And clearly there are $2^n$ of labelled recoupling diagrams for every recoupling diagram, one for each basis state.
A computation in PQC is given by the following procedure:
\begin{definition}[PQC]\label{pqcomputation} 
	Given a permutation $\pi$: %and an error threshold $\epsilon$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Prepare a simultaneous eigenstate $\ket{\lambda} = \ket{j_{12}, j_{123}, \ldots, J, M}$ of $ S_{12}^2, \, S_{123}^2, \, \ldots S^2, Z$. Such basis (ie. the sequentially coupled basis) plays the role of computational basis .  %Once the fusion diagram is fixed, this can be a superposition over different tree labelings. 
		%The state can be in principle preprocessed by polarizing the spins by external magnetic field {\color{blue} [Improve the state preparation argument]}.
		\item Measure the following  set of observables: $S_{ \pi(1)\pi(2) }^2, \, S_{ \pi(1)\pi(2)\pi(3) }^2, \, \ldots S^2, Z$. This is equivalent to applying a sequence of \textsf{SWAP} gates $U_\pi$ in the quantum circuit model and measuring a $J$-spin eigenstate $\ket{x} = \ket{j_{12}', j_{123}', \ldots, J', M'}$ in the sequentially coupled basis.	
		\item The computing result is obtained by repeating steps 1 and 2 polynomially many times to yield an approximation of the probability distribution $P_\pi (x|\lambda) = | \bra{x} U_\pi \ket{\lambda}|^2 $.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
In his paper \cite{Jordan09}, Jordan shows that PQC can approximate the irreducible representations of the symmetric group in polynomial tyme. This is a relatively surprising result as this problem no classical polynomial time algorithm is known that solves the same problem. This hints that although the the PQC model seems trivial in comparison with other quantum computation models it is still superior to classical computation. Any PQC computation (\ref{pqcomputation}), corresponds to a sequence of phase and racah moves.
\begin{definition}[Phase and Racah moves]
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Biedenharn-Louck \cite{Aquilanti09}] 
	Let $A,B,C$ be disjoint sets of qubits and use the shorthand $AB := A \cup B$.
	Any quantum state corresponding to a labelled recoupling diagram can be transformed to a superposition of sequentially coupled labelled recoupling diagram states using a $poly(n)$ sequence of Racah and Phase moves.
\end{theorem}
Those moves have a general categorical description as we will see.

\subsubsection{Categorical PQC}
The theory of permutational quantum computing is based on the following abstract ingredients:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A tensor product to model many-body quantum systems
	\item A direct product to model superpositions of particle types.
	\item A set of labels of particle types (with antiparticle for each type) generating all other systems together with fusion rules which account for coupling of those particle types.
	\item A permutational structure, i.e the possibility to permute particle positions, i.e phase moves
	\item The Racah or $F$ moves which models changes of basis.
	\item Underlying Hilbert spaces which account for the quantum mechanical nature of the model.
\end{enumerate}
Let us build a class of categories which account for all those ingredients. As already argued in the previous section we need the structure of a tensor category in order to model many-body quantum systems together with superpositions. We then require the category to contain a simple object for each particle type and to be semisimple so that we obtain fusion rules (see appendix). Note that we do not require there to be finitely many simple objects as in the anyonic case. Indeed note that if we want a theory to reproduce Jordan's model for any chosen number of particles ($n$), the theory must contain infinitely many particle types, one for each half-integer value (value of angular momentum). We must also require the category to be rigid so that for we have antiparticles for each particle type. A tensor category is monoidal so it comes with associators which precisely model the equivalent of the Racah moves. For the permutational structure we require the theory to have a symmetric structure. And finally, if we want to recover finite dimensional Hilbert spaces underlying the objects of our theory we can impose the existence of a forgetful functor to $FHilb \simeq FVect$. Putting it all together we have obtained a rigid semisimple symmetric tensor category $\cat$ equipped with a fiber functor $F: \cat \rightarrow FVect$. We will call those categories Tannakian for our purposes.\\
The following theorem shows that any group and supergroup induces a model for permutational quantum computation.
\begin{theorem}[Doplicher-Roberts]
	If $\mathcal{C}$ is a rigid semisimple symmetric tensor category equipped with a fiber functor to $Vect$ then $\mathcal{C}$ is symmetrically monoidally equivalent to $Rep(G)$ for $G$ some group (if the twist is trivial) or some supergroup (if the twist is -1).
\end{theorem}
And in fact we recognize Jordan's model as the theory of representations of the special unitary group.
\begin{proposition}
	Jordan's qubit model $\mathcal{J}_2$ is the category of representations of $SU(2)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Irreducible representations of $SU(2)$ are precisely indexed by half-integer values and the fusion rules given by angular addition rules \cite{Woit17}.
\end{proof}
We can easily see that defining $\mathcal{J}_d := Rep(SU(d))$ we obtain the corresponding qu$d$it model for permutational quantum computation. The permutational structure of the categories under observation, is tightly linked to the symmetric group $S_n$. In his model, Jordan builds an algorithm to compute representations of $S_n$, this can be done in any PQC category.
\begin{proposition}
	Any Tannakian category $\cat$ induces representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a simple object $a \in obj(\cat)$ then $S_n$ acts on $a^{\otimes n}$ by permutations, and this clearly defines a module as we can consider $a$ as a vector space using the fiber functor.
\end{proof}

\subsection{A braided representation of quantum computation}
For an abelian group $G$, we have seen that $Rep(DG)$ doesn't contain enough states to model preparations and measurements. But we will see that for suitably chosen $G$, $Rep(DG)$ contains a universal set of gates as braids. In this section we use functorial boxes \cite{Mellies06} to map the braided pictures in $Rep(DG)$ down to $Hilb$ and obtain a braided representation of quantum gates. This will allow us to to describe preparations and measurements in $Hilb$ and quantum gates as boxed braids from $Rep(DG)$.\\
We know from [drinfeld center section] that $Rep(DG) \simeq \mathcal{D}_G^{lr}$, so specifying an object of $Rep(DG)$ just corresponds to choosing a vector space $V$ with a left $G$-module structure  and right $G$-comodule structure.\\
Let $G:= \mathbb{Z}_2$, the reason why we chose this group will become apparent later on, many other choices are possible. Let us denote the standard basis of $\mathbb{C}G$ by $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1}\}$. This has natural Hopf algebra structure with multiplication given by $\ket{i}\otimes \ket{j} \mapsto \ket{i+j}$ (where $+$ is addition modulo $2$) and comultiplication given by the copy map $\ket{i} \mapsto \ket{i}\otimes \ket{i} $.\\
We now choose a two-dimensional object of $Rep(DG)$ to serve as our qubit. Take $V=\mathbb{C}^2$ with the $Z$ $G$-action and $X$ $G$-coaction.

	\section{Tensor categories}
	Categorification is the process of replacing sets by categories, functions by functors and weakening equalities to natural isomorphisms. Tensor categories are the categorification of rings. Multiplication becomes a tensor product $\otimes$ and addition becomes a direct product $\oplus$. Monoidal categories are defined in the first chapter of the thesis. They are obtained by categorifying the notion of a monoid. We also defined rigidity, as the property that any object has a right dual and a left dual. The notion of tensor categories is obtained by considering rigid monoidal structures on abelian categories.\\
	Let us start with the theory of abelian categories.
	\begin{definition}[Ab category]
		The category $\mathcal{C}$ is Ab if it is enriched over abelian groups. That is all hom-sets have abelian group structures and composition of morphisms is a group homomorphism. 
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Zero object]
		We say $0$ is a zero object if 
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Direct sums]
	A category $\mathcal{C}$ has direct sums if it has a monoidal structure with tensor $\oplus$ and such that $\oplus$ is the categorical product ad coproduct. This means for any objects $A,B \in obj(\cat)$ the direct product $A\oplus B$ comes with projections $p_A$, $p_B$ and injections $i_A$, $i_B$ satisfying the universal properties of the categorical product and coproduct.
	\end{definition}
	For $\oplus$ to be the categorical product means that for any morphisms $f:C \rightarrow A$ $g: C \rightarrow B$ there is a unique arrow $h: C \rightarrow A \oplus B$ such that $p_A\circ h = f$ and $p_B \circ h =g$. The universal property of the coproduct is the dual notion where all arrows are flipped and projections are replaced by injections.
	\begin{definition}[Additive category]
		An Ab-category $\mathcal{C}$ is additive if it has zero object and every pair of objects has a direct sum $\oplus$.
	\end{definition}
	In an additive category, the zero object allows us to define kernels and cokernels.
	\begin{definition}[Kernel and cokernel]
		content...
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Abelian category]
		An abelian category is an additive category where every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel and every monic (epic) is a kernel (cokernel).
	\end{definition} 

	\begin{definition}[k-linear category]
	Let k be field, we say $\mathcal{C}$ is $k$-linear if all hom-sets are k-vector spaces and composition is bilinear.
	\end{definition}
	
	\section{Fusion categories}
	Many of the results and definitions  of this section can be found in \cite{Mueger08}, \cite{Bartlett15} and \cite{Freyd66}.
	We will assume throughout the thesis that $k=\mathbb{C}$ so in particular the field is algebraically closed. 
	\begin{definition}
		An object $X$ in a $\mathbb{C}$-linear category is called simple if End$X=k$id$_X$.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}
		$\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple if every object is isomorphic to a direct sum of simple objects. $\mathcal{C}$ is finite if there are finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}
		A $\mathbb{C}$-linear tensor category is a fusion category if it has finite-dimensional hom-spaces, is semisimple with finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects, the unit $\mathbf{1}$ is simple  and all objects have duals.
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{theorem}
		$Rep(H)$ is a fusion category
	\end{theorem}
	
	\begin{example}
		Any group $G$ is a hopf algebra (comonoid = copy).\\
		Therefore $RepG$ can also be made monoidal and rigid.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{example}
		Recall the group $S_3=\{e, g, g^2, \sigma, \sigma g, \sigma g^2 \}$. The category $Rep(S_3)$ is a fusion category. By the known representation theory of $S_3$, $Rep(S_3)$ has three simple objects: the trivial representation $1$, the sign representation $-1$ and the geometric two dimensional representation $\tau$:
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		\tau : \quad & \sigma \mapsto \left( {\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{array}}\right) \\
		& g \mapsto \left( {\begin{array}{cc} \omega & 0 \\ 0 & \bar{\omega} \end{array}}\right)
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		These satisfy the following fusion rules $\forall X$ simple object:
		\begin{equation}
		1 \otimes X \simeq X \simeq X \otimes 1\\
		-1 \otimes -1 \simeq 1\\
		-1 \otimes \tau \simeq \tau \simeq \tau \otimes -1\\
		\tau \otimes \tau \simeq 1 \oplus -1 \oplus \tau\\
		\end{equation}		
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{example}[Graph invariants from spherical fusion categories]
	\end{example}

	\begin{theorem}
		If $\mathcal{C}$ is $k$-linear, spherical or a *-category (k-linear dagger) then so is $Z_1(\mathcal{C})$ 
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{theorem}
		If $H$ is a quasitriangular Hopf Algebra then $Rep(H)$ is a braided fusion category.
	\end{theorem}
